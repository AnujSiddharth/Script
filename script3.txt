EXT. FOREST TRAIL – MORNING

The sun peeks through the tall pine trees. Birds chirp. EMMA, 40s, jogs with her dog, MAX.

EMMA
Keep up, Max!

The dog barks and runs ahead. Suddenly, Max stops and growls at something in the bushes.

EMMA
What is it, boy?

She walks over, pushes the leaves aside — revealing a rusted metal box buried in the dirt.

She kneels, opens it slowly. Inside is a faded photograph and a key.

EMMA
What on earth...?
