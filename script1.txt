INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A clock ticks loudly in the silence. JAMES, late 20s, sits on the couch staring at a blank TV screen. His phone vibrates. He doesn’t move.

Suddenly, a KNOCK at the door. He turns his head slowly.

JAMES
(quietly)
Who could that be?

He walks to the door and opens it to find LISA, early 30s, holding a small box.

LISA
You forgot this.

She hands him the box. He stares at it, confused.

JAMES
I thought I lost it...

LISA
You did. But I found it — in the drawer where you hide things.

She smiles faintly and walks away into the night.

JAMES looks at the box, then closes the door gently.
