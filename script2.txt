INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

A clock ticks in the quiet room. JAMES, in his late 20s, is slouched on the couch, staring at a blank TV. His phone buzzes. He ignores it.

There's a soft KNOCK at the door. He looks toward it.

JAMES
(low voice)
Who’s that?

He slowly opens the door. LISA, early 30s, stands there with a small box in hand.

LISA
You left this behind.

He takes the box, puzzled.

JAMES
I thought it was gone...

LISA
You hid it, remember? I found it where you usually stash things.

She walks off into the dark. JAMES holds the box, lost in thought, and closes the door behind him.
