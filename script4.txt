INT. COFFEE SHOP – DAY

The café is buzzing with quiet chatter. ALEX, early 20s, nervously taps a pen at a table by the window.

MIRA, late 20s, walks in and spots him. She smiles and approaches.

MIRA
Sorry I’m late. Traffic was chaos.

ALEX
It’s okay. I thought maybe you changed your mind.

MIRA
Not a chance. You said you had something important to say?

ALEX takes a deep breath and pulls out a folded letter.

ALEX
It’s... about your brother. He didn’t die in that crash.

MIRA stares at him, speechless.
